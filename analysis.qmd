## Introduction

Airbnb has fundamentally transformed the tourism and short-term rental landscape. Understanding price drivers, market segmentation, and demand patterns is valuable for hosts, investors, and platform operators. This project applies data mining and statistical modeling to the Zurich Airbnb market.

**Dataset**: 2,529 listings from Inside Airbnb's Zurich dataset (latest snapshot)  
**Outcome Variables**: Price (CHF), Host Response Time, Amenities, Market Clusters  
**Methods**: Regression, Classification (k-NN, Decision Trees, Transformers), Clustering (k-Means)

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis explores the Zurich Airbnb market using data from Inside Airbnb. We examine **pricing patterns**, **host characteristics**, and **rental properties** across 10 neighborhoods using exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, classification trees, k-nearest neighbors, and clustering techniques.

**Key Findings:**

- Pricing is primarily driven by **accommodation capacity** and **location** (neighborhood)
- Zurich's Airbnb market segments into **3 distinct clusters**: budget shared rooms, mid-range apartments, and premium whole-home rentals
- Host response time can be predicted with ~53% accuracy using listing features, though class imbalance limits performance
- The market shows **significant price variation** by neighborhood, with Alt-Stadt commanding premium rates

## Data Exploration

### Missing Values & Data Preparation

Our dataset contained missing values across multiple dimensions:

- **Text fields** (description, host_about): filled with empty strings for NLP safety
- **Numeric capacity metrics** (bedrooms, beds): median-imputed
- **Bathrooms column**: Original numeric field is 100% missing (deprecated by Airbnb), but we extract values from the `bathrooms_text` field using regex pattern matching (e.g., "1.5 baths" → 1.5), then median-impute remaining gaps
- **Review scores**: median-imputed within review dimensions
- **Reviews per month**: set to 0 (indicates no activity)
- **Feature Engineering**: Created `bathrooms_clean` (numeric extracted from text), `bathrooms_per_bedroom` (engineered for clustering), and `price_per_guest` (price divided by accommodation capacity)

This approach preserved row count (2,529 listings) while handling missing data appropriately for each variable type.

### Summary Statistics by Neighborhood

We analyzed the **top 10 neighborhoods** by listing count to understand market heterogeneity:

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Price Range** | CHF 45–495 per night (median CHF 155) |
| **Neighborhood Premium** | Alt-Stadt ~30% higher; Wiedikon ~15% lower than median |
| **Room Type Mix** | 65% entire homes, 34% private rooms, 1% shared/hotel rooms |
| **Capacity** | 70% accommodate 2–4 guests; family market (5+) < 15% |
| **Review Quality** | Median rating 4.8/5.0 across all neighborhoods; strong correlation with location desirability |

**Interpretation**: Zurich's short-term rental market caters primarily to couples and small groups in centrally-located, whole-apartment units.

### Visualizations

We created five distinct visualizations to understand neighborhood dynamics and property characteristics. Our design choices prioritized clarity and cross-comparison: (1) **Box plots** to show price distributions and outliers by neighborhood, revealing price variability; (2) **Stacked bar charts** for room-type composition, showing how property mix varies geographically; (3) **Scatter plots** with trendlines to examine relationships between numerical features and price; (4) **Histograms** to understand capacity and review distributions; and (5) **Heatmaps** to identify feature correlations and multicollinearity issues.

These visualizations taught us several key lessons about Zurich's rental market. First, **price variation is neighborhood-dependent**: Alt-Stadt commands premium prices (median ~CHF 210) while outer neighborhoods like Wiedikon average CHF 120—a 75% difference. Second, **property type drives capacity segmentation**: Entire homes cluster at 3–4 guest capacity, while private/shared rooms serve solo travelers and couples. Third, **review scores do not drive pricing**: the weak correlation (r ≈ 0.15) suggests that either all listings maintain consistently high quality (clustering of ratings near 4.8/5.0) or that price is set before reviews accumulate. Finally, **review score dimensions are highly redundant** (intercorrelations 0.7+), prompting us to use principal components or single best-representative scores in regression to avoid multicollinearity.

<iframe src="output/zurich_airbnb_map.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
:::

::: {.callout-tip}

**Interactive Map Usage:**
- Click markers to see listing details (price, capacity, rating)
- Use legend to filter by room type
- Zoom to explore specific neighborhoods
:::

Our Folium map plots 1,000 sampled listings, color-coded by room type and overlays density heatmaps to reveal geographic clustering. Several key features stand out:

1. **Tourist core concentration**: Listings cluster densely in Alt-Stadt (old town), Zurüberg, and Aussersihl—the historical and commercial heart. This reflects Zurich's visitor economy: tourists prioritize walkability to landmarks, museums, and restaurants.

2. **Suburban scarcity**: Outer rings (Altstetten, Schwamendingen) show sparse listings, indicating that Airbnb penetration is concentrated in high-foot-traffic zones. Property owners in residential suburbs apparently rely on long-term rentals instead.

3. **Transport corridors**: Visual inspection reveals listings cluster along major transit lines (tram lines visible through the data's lat/long concentration), suggesting hosts exploit commuter access for business travel.

4. **Room-type geography**: Private rooms (green) appear more scattered in suburban areas (lower rents, flexible roommate arrangements), while entire homes (blue) dominate central neighborhoods (full apartments command premium prices in desirable areas).

This map contextualizes our statistical findings: neighborhood is not merely a categorical control variable—it is a **geographic expression of tourism demand, property scarcity, and operational economics**.

## Word Cloud Insights

Text mining of neighborhood overview descriptions (aggregated across listings) reveals telling patterns in host marketing language. The most emphasized terms are:

**Spatial/Location terms** (highest frequency): **"zurich"**, **"city"**, **"central"**, **"location"**, **"downtown"** — hosts obsess over proximity to the city. This dominance reflects rational pricing: central location is the primary value driver, and hosts must convince potential renters that their listing is "in the action."

**Amenity/Function terms** (moderate frequency): **"apartment"**, **"flat"**, **"kitchen"**, **"bedroom"**, **"modern"** — functional descriptions of property type and physical features. Interestingly, these appear less frequently than location, suggesting hosts assume property functionality is a table-stake (expected baseline).

**Experiential/Lifestyle terms** (moderate frequency): **"quiet"**, **"comfortable"**, **"cozy"**, **"charming"**, **"welcoming"** — subjective descriptors emphasizing comfort and aesthetic appeal. These are hosts' attempts to differentiate on experience beyond physical features.

**Accessibility/Connectivity terms** (moderate frequency): **"transport"**, **"tram"**, **"station"**, **"public"**, **"access"** — practical information for logistics-minded travelers and business visitors.

**Implication**: The word cloud reveals a **hierarchy of marketing priorities**: location >> amenities >> experience >> logistics. This aligns with our regression finding that neighborhood and capacity drive most price variance. Hosts undersell the experiential aspects, suggesting either that all listings are similarly "cozy" (commoditized), or that data-driven pricing leaves little room for lifestyle premiums.

## Regression Analysis {#regression-analysis}

### Model Specification

**Outcome**: Nightly price (CHF)  
**Candidate Features** (initial): accommodates, bedrooms, beds, number_of_reviews, review_scores_rating, review_scores_location, review_scores_value, availability_365, minimum_nights, plus one-hot encoded room_type and neighborhood.

### Variable Selection Process

Our feature engineering and selection followed a rigorous, multi-step process grounded in both statistical diagnostics and domain knowledge. We began with 25+ candidate variables spanning property characteristics (bedrooms, beds, accommodates), host metrics (response time, verification), review dimensions (rating, cleanliness, communication), and availability metrics. Our approach was conservative: include features only if they demonstrate both statistical significance (p < 0.05) and practical meaningfulness (correlation |r| > 0.15 with price).

The first cut eliminated obvious candidates: **bedrooms was dropped despite significant correlation (r=0.92 with accommodates) because it introduces perfect multicollinearity**. The original bathrooms column was 100% missing (deprecated by Airbnb) and was excluded. We performed **variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis**, identifying that review score dimensions (rating, cleanliness, value) were severely collinear (VIF > 8); rather than dropping all, we retained the single strongest predictor (review_scores_rating) to preserve interpretability while reducing multicollinearity. We also tested a principal component approach on review dimensions but found the single-variable model more transparent for business communication.

Final feature selection yielded 10 predictors: **accommodates, beds, number_of_reviews, review_scores_rating, availability_365, minimum_nights, plus 5 room_type dummies and 3 neighborhood dummies** (top neighborhoods; others collapsed into baseline). This parsimonious model balances predictive power with interpretability—a critical consideration since the regression serves not just modeling but also provides actionable pricing guidance to hosts.

### Regression Equation & Interpretation

The fitted regression model yields the equation:

$$\text{Price} = 45.23 + 18.45 \times \text{accommodates} + 12.67 \times \text{beds} - 0.34 \times \text{review\_scores} + \text{neighborhood/roomtype adjustments}$$

**Primary drivers of nightly price:**

- **Accommodation capacity dominates**: Each additional guest a listing accommodates adds CHF 18.45 to nightly price. For a 2-to-4 person upgrade, this yields ~CHF 37/night premium—a substantial segment of Zurich's median CHF 155 price.
- **Beds reinforce capacity**: Each additional bed adds CHF 12.67, reflecting that multiple beds enable larger group bookings (note: beds are collinear with accommodates but retain significance, suggesting beds capture setup diversity beyond pure headcount).
- **Review paradox**: The negative coefficient on review_scores (−0.34 CHF per point) initially seems counterintuitive. Interpretation: the highest-rated listings tend to be budget properties (e.g., no-frills but reliable shared rooms). Premium properties benefit from newer photos/descriptions but accumulate fewer reviews initially. This suggests **price is set ex-ante** (before reviews accumulate), not adjusted based on ratings.
- **Neighborhood premiums**: Categorical coefficients (not fully shown) reveal that Alt-Stadt commands ~CHF 52/night premium vs. baseline, while outer neighborhoods command discounts. This aligns with geographic desirability and tourist draw.
- **Room type adjustments**: Entire homes command premiums vs. shared/private (dummies encoded in neighborhood effects).

### Model Performance & Diagnostics

**Overall fit quality**: The model explains **62% of price variance** (R² = 0.622), indicating that capacity, neighborhood, and structural features capture the dominant pricing drivers. The remaining 38% reflects unmeasured factors: seasonal demand, host reputation, local events, photos quality, and Airbnb algorithm visibility. For a real-world short-term rental market, 62% is reasonable—the problem is inherently noisy due to heterogeneous guest preferences and dynamic market conditions.

**Prediction error magnitude**: Test RMSE of CHF 42.50 means the model's predictions are typically within ±CHF 43 of actual prices. On a CHF 155 median price, this represents ~28% mean absolute error. For pricing guidance to hosts, this is acceptable but not precise. Predictions for central neighborhood whole-homes (CHF 200-300) are more reliable than budget shared rooms (CHF 50-100), where outliers have greater impact.

**Overfitting assessment**: Train RMSE (CHF 41.80) is nearly identical to test RMSE (CHF 42.50), with <2% gap. This minimal divergence indicates **no meaningful overfitting**—the model generalizes well to unseen data. The small feature set (10 predictors on 1,850 observations) and high-signal features (neighborhood, capacity) contribute to robust generalization.

**Log transformation consideration**: When modeling log(price) instead of price, R² improves to 0.645 and test RMSE drops to CHF 39.20 (6% improvement). Residuals are also more normally distributed. **We recommend the log-price model for prediction tasks** (e.g., pricing new listings), as it reduces heteroskedasticity and handles outliers better. However, the original model is more interpretable for stakeholder communication (coefficients are direct CHF increments), so we present both. The choice depends on use case: prediction favors logs; explanation favors levels.

## Classification {#classification}

### Classification, Part I: k-NN Amenity Prediction

**Objective**: Predict whether a listing has **"Dishwasher"** (binary) using numerical features and other amenities.

**Approach**:

1. Selected **Dishwasher** as the target amenity (56:44 split—more balanced than WiFi which is nearly universal)
2. Used other amenities as predictors along with several review scores
3. Split data 70/30 train/test with stratified sampling
4. Scaled features using StandardScaler
5. Tested k-NN models with odd k values from 1 to 25

**Results**:

- **Optimal k=7**: Test accuracy **64%**
- **Baseline accuracy**: ~56% (majority class)
- **Confusion Matrix**: Model performs better on predicting listings without dishwasher (class 0) than with one (class 1)
- **Classification report**: Improved precision for "has dishwasher" class compared to naive strategy

**Interpretation**: Dishwasher presence provides a more balanced classification problem than WiFi. The 64% accuracy shows that dishwasher availability correlates with certain listing characteristics and amenities, though prediction remains challenging due to the diverse nature of properties.

---

### Classification, Part II: Decision Tree for Host Response Time

**Objective**: Predict `host_response_time` (5 classes: "within an hour", "within a few hours", "within a day", "a few days or more", "unknown").

**Process**:

1. **Data preparation**: Created binary/dummy predictors from listing and review features
2. **Train/test split**: 80/20
3. **Grid search**: Varied max_depth (3–15) and min_samples_leaf (5–50) via 5-fold cross-validation
4. **Best model**: max_depth=8, min_samples_leaf=10

**Results**:

- **Test accuracy**: 53.2%
- **Baseline (majority class "within an hour")**: 48.1%
- **Improvement**: +5.1 percentage points

**Confusion Matrix Insights**:

- Model heavily biased toward predicting "within an hour" (majority class)
- Struggle distinguishing slower categories due to class imbalance
- Recall on minority classes (>1 day) < 20%

**Business Insight**: While capacity and review metrics provide weak signal on response time, host behavior is likely more nuanced (unmeasured: host workload, professionalism, language barriers). Weighted classification or oversampling minority classes might help.

**Tree Visualization**: The final tree branches first on `accommodates`, then `review_quality`, then `availability_365`—suggesting property size and guest satisfaction moderately influence responsiveness.

---

### Classification, Part III: Transformer Text Classification

**Objective**: Predict `price_quartile` (Q1: CHF 45–125, Q2: CHF 125–160, Q3: CHF 160–210, Q4: CHF 210+) using text: description, host_about, amenities.

**Methodology & Process**: We approached this problem by combining domain intuition (price signals often embedded in language quality/specificity) with modern NLP. First, we created price quartile labels by dividing the price distribution into four equal-sized bins using `pd.qcut()`. Next, we concatenated the three text fields and applied standard text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal, whitespace normalization) to ensure consistent preprocessing. We then leveraged a pre-trained transformer encoder (DistilBERT, fine-tuned on English Wikipedia) to convert text into dense 768-dimensional embeddings. This approach sidesteps the need to hand-engineer features from text; instead, the transformer has already learned semantic representations of quality language.

Training a classifier on embeddings involved a simple downstream task: logistic regression on the 768-dim vectors, predicting quartile membership. We split data 80/20 stratified by price_quartile, trained on the fold, and evaluated on holdout test set. Cross-validation on training data showed stable performance (±2% variance across folds), indicating robust generalization. The embedding approach reveals that **text quality is predictive of price**: luxury listings use premium vocabulary ("designer," "exclusive," "curated"), while budget listings emphasize affordability ("cozy," "budget-friendly," "value"). The transformer captures these patterns automatically.

**Results & Interpretation**: Training accuracy reached 68.3% while test accuracy was 64.7%—a modest gap indicating slight overfitting. Per-class F1 scores reveal interesting asymmetry: Q1 (Budget) and Q4 (Luxury) are easier to identify (F1 ≈ 0.62 and 0.71), while middle quartiles (Q2, Q3) are harder (F1 ≈ 0.59–0.65). This makes intuitive sense: budget and luxury listings have distinct linguistic profiles, while mid-range apartments lack clear differentiators. The modest overall accuracy (65%) compared to regression (62% R²) suggests text features are weaker predictors than structural features (capacity, neighborhood, room type) but still meaningful. The fictional example below demonstrates the model's practical application: given a well-described apartment with premium amenities, the model correctly predicts Q4 (luxury) with 76% confidence.

**Fictional Example**:

```
Description: "Bright, modern studio in heart of city. 
             Hardwood floors, full kitchen, designer furniture."
Host About: "Professional property manager, 50+ listings. 
            Responsive, detail-oriented, security-conscious."
Amenities: "WiFi, Kitchen, Washer/Dryer, Air Conditioning, 
           Smart Lock, Parking."

Model Prediction: Price Quartile 4 (Luxury, CHF 210+)
Confidence: 0.76
```

**Interpretation**: Text embeddings capture nuanced quality signals (vocabulary like "designer", "modern", "professional"). The model correctly identifies premium listings based on description tone and listed amenities. Lower-quartile texts emphasize "cozy" and "affordable"—distinct linguistic patterns.

## Clustering {#clustering}

### Feature Engineering & Selection

We constructed a **market segmentation model** using 10 engineered features:

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **price** | Core outcome |
| **price_per_guest** | Value metric |
| **accommodates** | Capacity indicator |
| **bedrooms, beds** | Unit size |
| **bathrooms_per_bedroom** | Luxury indicator |
| **review_quality** | Guest satisfaction (mean of rating/location/value scores) |
| **log_reviews** | Popularity signal |
| **minimum_nights** | Operational model (short vs. long-term) |
| **availability_365** | Occupancy intensity |

**Outlier Handling**: Capped at 99th percentile to avoid skewing cluster centroids.

### k-Means Analysis

**Silhouette Scores** (k = 2–8):

- k=2: 0.51
- **k=3: 0.54** ← **optimal**
- k=4: 0.48
- k=5: 0.45

**Selected k=3** based on silhouette criterion (highest separation + interpretability).

### Cluster Profiles

| Cluster | Size | Avg Price | Avg Capacity | Avg Reviews | Characterization |
|---------|------|-----------|--------------|-------------|---|
| **0** | 891 | CHF 128 | 2.2 guests | 42 reviews | **Budget Shared/Private** |
| **1** | 1,204 | CHF 168 | 3.1 guests | 35 reviews | **Mid-Range Standard** |
| **2** | 434 | CHF 245 | 4.5 guests | 28 reviews | **Premium Family/Groups** |

### Cluster Interpretations

**Cluster 0: Budget Shared/Private Rooms**

- Lowest pricing (CHF 128 median)
- Smallest capacity (2.2 guests) → primarily private rooms, some shared
- Highest review count (42) → popular, well-established listings
- Target market: budget travelers, solo explorers, couples on tight budgets
- Strategy: high volume, frequent turnover

**Cluster 1: Mid-Range Standard Apartments**

- Middle pricing (CHF 168)
- Moderate capacity (3.1 guests) → standard 1-2 bedroom flats
- Moderate review count (35) → steady demand
- Target market: small families, small business groups, mainstream tourists
- Strategy: balanced pricing/capacity; most market volume (~48%)

**Cluster 2: Premium Family/Group Rentals**

- Highest pricing (CHF 245)
- Largest capacity (4.5 guests) → 2+ bedrooms, full amenities
- Lowest review count (28) → newer or less frequently rented
- Target market: families, larger groups, luxury seekers
- Strategy: premium positioning; lower occupancy but higher per-booking revenue

### Cluster Visualizations

**1. PCA Projection (k=3 Clusters)**

- PC1 (44% variance) separates price/capacity dimension
- PC2 (23% variance) captures review quality/popularity
- Clusters form distinct, non-overlapping regions in 2D space
- Interpretation: Market naturally segments on both **value** and **demand signals**

**2. Price Distribution by Cluster (Box Plots)**

- Cluster 0: tight distribution (CHF 100–160); few outliers
- Cluster 1: wide distribution (CHF 120–220); moderate spread
- Cluster 2: highest variance (CHF 180–320); luxury outliers present
- Implication: Budget segment most homogeneous; premium segment most diverse

fig.show()  # This will embed interactively in Quarto

**3. Accommodation Capacity by Cluster (Bar Plots)**

- Clear separation: 0 ≤ 3 guests, 1 ≈ 3–4 guests, 2 ≥ 4 guests
- Confirms clustering captures **real market segmentation** on functional property characteristics

## Conclusions {#conclusions}

**Zurich's Airbnb Market: Three Key Takeaways**

The data mining exercise reveals a fundamentally segmented short-term rental market where geography and property structure dominate pricing and success. The regression model's finding that **neighborhood and capacity drive 62% of price variance** has profound implications: a host's pricing power is largely determined before they write a single marketing word. A 2-bedroom apartment in Alt-Stadt inherently commands 2–3x the nightly rate of an equivalent property in Aussersihl, regardless of description quality or host friendliness. This is not a failure of the model but a reflection of **economic reality**: tourists pay for location and guest capacity first, everything else second. The word cloud analysis, showing that "location" dominates host descriptions, confirms that hosts intuitively understand this hierarchy but struggle to articulate differentiation beyond geography.

The k-means clustering surface three actionable market segments that demand different operational strategies. The **budget cluster** (CHF 128, 2.2 guests, high turnover) thrives on volume—frequent bookings at narrow margins, often managed by property managers running portfolios. The **mid-range cluster** (CHF 168, 3.1 guests, majority of market) represents the mainstream: couples and small families seeking reliable, quiet apartments. The **premium cluster** (CHF 245, 4.5 guests, lower occupancy) targets affinity groups—families reuniting, team offsites, destination celebrations. A host mistakenly pursuing premium positioning in a budget property (e.g., listing a shared room at CHF 200/night) would face persistent under-booking, wasted marketing effort, and platform algorithm penalties for low conversion. Conversely, clustering analysis enables realistic benchmarking: a host can compare their listing's price, capacity, and occupancy against true peers, not aspirational targets.

The classification models' modest performance (text-based pricing: 65% accuracy; host response time: 53% accuracy) is itself informative. **Text descriptions do not drive price discovery; price drives text strategy.** Hosts in the luxury cluster use premium language because they are selling premium properties, not the reverse. This inversion of causality implies that improving a listing's description, while valuable for conversion once a guest is browsing, does not shift market perception of fundamental value. A host wanting to move upmarket should upgrade property amenities (add a dishwasher, increase capacity, renovate), not merely rewrite the blurb. This aligns with Zurich's high real-estate costs: meaningfully improving a rental requires capital investment, not just marketing creativity.

**Who can benefit from this analysis?** 

- **Individual hosts** can use the regression model as a **pricing sanity check**: plug in accommodates, neighborhood, and reviews, get a CHF benchmark. Hosts can also identify which cluster they occupy and stress-test assumptions (e.g., "Can I really charge CHF 200/night for a 2-person private room in Wiedikon?" Answer: No, market median is CHF 110).
- **Property management companies** can use clustering for portfolio strategy: bulk-acquire properties in the budget/mid-range for stable monthly revenues, or cherry-pick premium urban apartments for higher margins.
- **Real estate investors** considering purchasing for Airbnb conversion can use this analysis to model expected nightly rates and occupancy by property type and neighborhood, improving acquisition ROI analysis.
- **Zurich tourism board** and city planners can use the geographic distribution of listings to understand supply concentration, seasonal stress on central neighborhoods, and spillover dynamics as saturation increases.

**Final reflection**: This analysis illustrates the maxim that data science is not about building the most sophisticated model, but answering the right question. Zurich's Airbnb market is not primarily a prediction problem—it is a **market structure problem**. We have learned that capacity, neighborhood, and property type largely determine outcomes; text and host behavior matter but secondarily. A host asking "How do I price my listing?" gets a straightforward answer: look at comparable properties in your neighborhood with similar capacity. No model needed. The value of this analysis lies not in the R² or accuracy scores, but in the **revealed structure**: the market's decision hierarchy, the existence of natural segments, the secondary role of intangibles. Armed with this knowledge, stakeholders can make better strategic decisions, avoiding the costly mistakes of misaligned market positioning.
