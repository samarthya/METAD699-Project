# Setting the Stage: Understanding Zurich's Rental Market

---

## The Challenge

How can Zurich Airbnb hosts understand their market position?

::: {.incremental}

- **Fragmented information:** 2,529 listings across 10 neighborhoods
- **Pricing uncertainty:** What should I charge for my property?
- **Competitive gaps:** How do I compare to similar properties?
- **Investment decisions:** Where should I focus improvement efforts?

**Solution:** Data-driven analysis of market structure, pricing drivers, and natural segments

:::

## Dataset: Comprehensive Zurich Airbnb Market

**Data Coverage:**

- **2,529** complete listings analyzed
- **10 neighborhoods** with 50+ features each
- **Sources:** Inside Airbnb (publicly available)
- **Features:** Price, capacity, amenities, quality signals, descriptions

---

## Data Quality: Missing Values Challenge

![Missing Values Handling](output/missing_values_analysis.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

**Key Finding:** ~100% missing "bathrooms" data required feature engineering; other fields nearly complete

---

## Market Composition: Room Type Distribution

![Room Type Composition](output/room_type_composition.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}

**Structure:** 60% entire homes/apartments; 40% private/shared rooms

---

## Price Distribution by Neighborhood

![Price Distribution Neighborhoods](output/price_distribution_neighborhoods.png){width="85%" fig-align="center"}

**Insight:** Alt-Stadt commands 2–3x premium over budget neighborhoods; natural price stratification by location

---

# Exploratory Analysis: Market Insights

---

## Price Distribution: Histogram Analysis

![Price Distribution Histograms](output/price_distribution_histograms.png){width="85%" fig-align="center"}

Median: **CHF 160/night** | Range: CHF 50–450+ | Right-skewed with luxury outliers

---

## Capacity Distribution: Guest Accommodation

![Capacity Distribution](output/capacity_distribution.png){width="85%" fig-align="center"}

**Peak:** 2–3 guest properties dominate (couples, small families); few large-group properties

---

## Word Cloud: Host Marketing Strategy

![Word Cloud](output/word_cloud.png){width="85%" fig-align="center"}

**Key insight:** "Location" dominates host descriptions — but does text quality drive price discovery?

---

## Feature Correlations: What Drives Price?

![Correlation Heatmap](output/correlation_heatmap.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

**Strong signals:** Accommodates, beds, review scores, neighborhood | **Weak signals:** Description length, host experience

---

## Price vs Review Scores: Quality Correlation

![Price vs Review Scores](output/price_vs_review_scores.png){width="85%" fig-align="center"}

**Finding:** Higher-priced listings get better reviews (R = 0.45) — likely price determines demand, not reverse

---

# Building Credibility: Regression Modeling

---

## Regression Analysis: Price Prediction Model

### Research Question
What features determine nightly price in Zurich's Airbnb market?

### Methodology
- **Variable Selection:** Correlation screening + VIF analysis for multicollinearity
- **Target:** Log-transformed price (handles right-skewed distribution)
- **Features:** Accommodates, beds, review scores, neighborhood dummies
- **Training:** 80% of 2,529 listings; tested on holdout set

---

## Feature Engineering: Technical Decisions

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Why Log Transformation?**
- Raw prices are right-skewed (outliers inflate residuals)
- Log scale stabilizes variance
- Linear regression assumptions better met
- Predictions: exponentiate back to CHF

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Multicollinearity Management:**
- Removed highly correlated features (VIF > 5)
- Kept: accommodates, beds, review scores
- Dropped: redundant neighborhood indicators
- Result: Interpretable coefficients

:::

:::

---

## Regression Results: Model Performance

![Regression Predictions](output/regression_predictions.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}

**R² = 0.622** (explains 62% of price variance) | **RMSE = CHF 42.50** | **Train/test gap < 2%** (no overfitting)

---

## What Drives Price? (Regression Coefficients)

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Numeric Features (Per Unit):**
- **+CHF 18.45** per accommodates
- **+CHF 12.67** per bed
- **+CHF 1.20** per review point

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Neighborhood Premiums:**
- **Alt-Stadt:** +CHF 86 (luxury)
- **City-center:** +CHF 30–60
- **Suburbs:** Baseline (–CHF 20–40)

Neighborhood alone = **30% of price variance**

:::

:::

---

## Model Limitations: Honest Assessment

**R² = 0.622 means:**
- ✓ 62% of price is explainable through measurable features
- ✗ 38% driven by unobserved factors: host reputation, exact location charm, seasonal demand, listing photos quality

**Takeaway:** Regression captures PRIMARY drivers but markets have inherent randomness

---

# Classification: Predicting Listing Attributes

---

## Classification I: k-NN Dishwasher Prediction

### Model Details
- **Algorithm:** k-Nearest Neighbors
- **Optimal k:** 7 (via cross-validation)
- **Target:** Dishwasher amenity (binary)
- **Accuracy:** **64%** (baseline: 56%)

**Finding:** Dishwasher correlates with price tier, capacity, and premium neighborhoods

---

## Classification II: Decision Tree - Host Response Time

### Model Details
- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree (max_depth=8, balanced weights)
- **Target:** Host response time (binary fast/slow)
- **Accuracy:** **53%** (baseline: 48%)

**Challenge:** Responsiveness influenced by unobserved host factors (automation, workload, personality)

**Lesson:** Behavioral attributes are weak predictors from listing features alone

---

## Classification III: Text Analysis - Price Quartile

### Model Details
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest on TF-IDF text features
- **Features:** Word frequency vectors from descriptions
- **Target:** Price quartile (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4)
- **Accuracy:** **65%** (test set)

**Critical Finding:** Text predicts only 15% better than baseline

**Interpretation:** Premium hosts use premium language BECAUSE they're selling premium property — not the reverse. Description rewriting alone won't move you upmarket.

---

## Classification Summary: Model Comparison

| Model | Task | Accuracy | Baseline | Δ | Interpretation |
|-------|------|----------|----------|---|---|
| k-NN | Dishwasher | 64% | 56% | +8% | Moderate predictability |
| Decision Tree | Response Time | 53% | 48% | +5% | Weak behavioral signal |
| Random Forest | Price Quartile | 65% | 50% | +15% | Limited text power |

**Message:** Listing features constrain outcomes more than they enable price discovery

---

# Clustering: Market Segmentation

---

## Clustering Methodology: Why k=3?

**k-Means Analysis: Finding Optimal Clusters**

![k-Means Silhouette Scores](output/kmeans_silhouette_scores.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}

**Silhouette score peaks at k=3 (0.54)** — mathematically justified 3-segment market

---

## Cluster Separation: Visual Proof (PCA)

![k-Means PCA Clusters](output/kmeans_pca_clusters_k3.png){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

**PC1 (36% variance):** Price × Capacity trade-off | **PC2 (18% variance):** Quality/demand signals

**Three distinct color clouds = natural market divisions** (not arbitrary)

## Cluster Price Structure: Not All Markets Are Alike

![Cluster Price Distribution](output/cluster_price_boxplot.png){width="85%" fig-align="center"}

- **Budget:** CHF 100–160 (tight, predictable)
- **Mid-range:** CHF 120–220 (moderate variance)
- **Premium:** CHF 180–450+ (high variance, niche outliers)

---

## Cluster Capacity: Guest Count Drives Segmentation

![Cluster Capacity Distribution](output/cluster_accommodates_barplot.png){width="85%" fig-align="center"}

**Primary segmenter:** Property accommodates capacity (0–2, 3–4, 4+) creates hard market boundaries

---

## Cluster Market Share: 74% Mid-Range Dominance

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Segment Distribution:**
- Budget: 19% (504 listings)
- Mid-range: 74% (1,875 listings)
- Premium: 7% (150 listings)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Business Implication:**
Most hosts compete in mid-range; differentiation hardest here; budget/premium niches may be less saturated
